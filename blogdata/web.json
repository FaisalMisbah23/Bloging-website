This might apply to anything from a simple plain-text webpage to a large web application or social network development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of web development<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>encompasses all related development activities, such as client-side scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security settings, e-commerce development, and content management system (CMS) development, in addition to web markup and code.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Web development skills are in high demand and pay well all across the world, making it a fantastic career choice. It is one of the most easily accessible higher-paying fields because it does not require a typical university degree. To master your skills, you can also take up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mygreatlearning.com\/web-development\/free-courses\/?gl_blog_ id=37848\">free web development courses<\/a> where you will get free online certificate.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The scope of web development is divided into two parts: front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server-side).&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s get into the specifics:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"front-end\"><strong>Front-end<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Everything that the end-user interacts with directly is referred to as client-side scripting or frontend development. Client-side code runs in a web browser and affects what visitors view when they visit a website. The frontend is in charge of things like layout, fonts, colours, menus, and contact forms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"back-end\"><strong>Back-end<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Backend development, also known as server-side scripting, is all about what happens behind the scenes. The section of a website that the user does not view is known as the backend. It\u2019s in charge of data storage and organization, as well as making sure everything on the client-side operates well. It accomplishes this via interacting with the front end. The browser sends a request to the server whenever something happens on the client-side, such as when a user fills out a form. The server-side \u201Cresponds\u201D by sending pertinent data to the browser in the form of frontend code, which the browser may interpret and display.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-web-development-and-web-design-differ\"><strong>How do web development and web design differ?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Albeit the terms web development and web design are now and then utilized conversely, they are not tradable.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine a web designer and a web developer working together to build a car: the developer would be in charge of all the functional components, such as the engine, wheels, and gears. The designer, on the other hand, would be responsible for visual aspects. How the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, and the design of the seats as well as the user experience provided by the car, so whether it\u2019s a slam dunk or not.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A website\u2019s style and feel are created by web designers. They create the layout of the website, making it logical, user-friendly, and entertaining to use. They think about all of the visual elements: what colour schemes and fonts will be used, for example. What types of buttons, scrollbars and drop-down menus should be included, and where should they be placed? To travel from point A to point B, the user interacts with which interactive touchpoints? Web design also considers the information architecture of the website, selecting what material should be included and where it should be placed.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Web design is a vast profession that is sometimes separated into more specific jobs such as User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and Information Architecture.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is the work of the web developer to turn this design into a live, fully functional website. The visual design provided by the web designer is built by a frontend developer utilising coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site\u2019s more advanced functionality, such as the checkout mechanism on an e-commerce site, is built by a backend developer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, a web designer is an architect and a web developer is an engineer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"who-is-a-web-developer\"><strong>Who is a Web Developer?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A web developer is a programmer who specialises in or works on developing client-server World Wide Web applications. In most cases, the applications use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mygreatlearning.com\/academy\/learn-for-free\/courses\/html-front-end-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HTML<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mygreatlearning.com\/academy\/learn-for-free\/courses\/front-end-development-css\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mygreatlearning.com\/academy\/learn-for-free\/courses\/intro-to-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JavaScript<\/a> on the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go, or Java on the server, and HTTP for client-server communication. Web applications are frequently developed and maintained using a web content management system.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-do-web-developers-do\"><strong>What do web developers do?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the fundamentals. You undoubtedly already know that web developers create websites, but there\u2019s a lot more to it. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, web developers must also examine user demands to ensure that the appropriate content, images, and underlying structure are employed to meet both the user\u2019s and the website\u2019s goals.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Coming up next are the absolute most regular duties:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Building websites with scripting languages<\/li><li>Writing, developing, and modifying webpage content, or directing others to do so.<\/li><li>Identifying and resolving issues discovered through testing or user input.<\/li><li>Converting text, visual, audio, and video elements into web-friendly forms<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A web developer has to design and maintain websites. Frontend, backend, and full-stack web developers have different roles and tasks depending on whether they work in-house or freelance. Full-stack developers are specialists in both frontend and backend development.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Web developers are in charge of creating a product that fits both the client\u2019s and the customer\u2019s or end user\u2019s needs. To comprehend the vision: how should the final website look and work, web developers engage with stakeholders, clients, and designers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mygreatlearning.com\/blog\/how-to-become-a-software-developer-in-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How to Become a Software Developer in 2021<\/a><\/em><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"frameworks-for-web-development-that-are-most-popular\"><strong>Frameworks for Web Development That Are Most Popular<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the market today, there are a plethora of web development frameworks to choose from.
